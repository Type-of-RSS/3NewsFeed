# Update NewsFeed's feed database from the commandline.

# Usage: update_feeds.py

# Note: If NewsFeed is running at the same time, it may overwrite the changes.
#       Then again, is NewsFeed is running, you don't need the script.

#       So the suggestion is to execute this script in a cron job so that
#       feeds stay updated even when NewsFeed is not running. No harm should
#       be done if NewsFeed happens to be running.
