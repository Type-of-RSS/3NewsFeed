<h3>Tue,  8 Nov 2005 15:03:49 -0600</h3>
<p>A new report indicates that the vast majority of the rapid temperature increase recently observed in Europe is likely due to an unexpected greenhouse gas: water vapor. Elevated surface temperatures due to other greenhouse gases have enhanced water evaporation and contributed to a cycle that stimulates further surface temperature increases, according to a report in Geophysical Research Letters. The research could help to answer a long-debated Earth science question about whether the water cycle could strongly enhance greenhouse warming.</p>

I've also mentioned <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2005/03/18/terminal-tips-how-to-get-tunes-off-of-your-ipod/">parts of this in the distant past</a>. Basically, I keep all of my music on my iPod and backed up elsewhere, managing my iPod manually, rather than letting it automatically sync with my iTunes Music folder. Why? Because I have a 12-inch Powerbook with a teeny little 80GB hard drive, so I'd rather not clutter it up with music that is already on my iPod. Whenever I want to listen to this music on my computer I simply plug my iPod into my computer. However, I worked out a little trick to ensure that I could also burn CDs of all the music on my iPod (that isn't on my computer) and basically move them back to my computer at will.<br /><br />
In any case, if you follow me after the jump, I'll show you how I did these things, and if you want to copy all the music from your old iPod to your new iPod, I'll walk you through one way of doing it...<br /><br />

They evaluated the results using software which is also used to assess the validity of circumstantial evidence. The findings would also stand up in court: there is a high degree of likelihood that both natural factors and greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming.

<p>A group of four-footed mammals that flourished worldwide for 40 million years and then died out in the ice ages is the missing link between the whale and its not-so-obvious nearest relative, the hippopotamus. The conclusion by University of California, Berkeley, post-doctoral fellow Jean-Renaud Boisserie and his French colleagues finally puts to rest the long-standing notion that the hippo is actually related to the pig or to its close relative, the South American peccary. In doing so, the finding reconciles the fossil record with the 20-year-old claim that molecular evidence points to the whale as the closest relative of the hippo.</p>

Remember when Grandma used to say 'don't go out in the cold; you'll get sick'? It turns out that she was right for a small number of people who have a condition called familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), in which individuals are afflicted by rash, fever, joint pain and flu-like symptoms ...
